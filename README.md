This repository contains the daily reports of my python classes.

#**Day 00: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebook**

On day 0, we were introduced to Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment. The session focused on how to navigate through the Jupyter interface, understanding its components, and getting familiar with working within this environment. We also learned how to run cells and explored basic jupyter notebook functions.

#**Daily Report: Day 3 - Version Control with Git (Local)**

On day 03, we focused on understanding and practicing version control using Git in a local repository. We explored how Git helps in tracking changes, managing different versions of files, and ensuring collaborative development in a controlled environment. The session also involved interacting with the Jupyter environment to implement Git commands and reference key concepts.
Key Takeaways:
[x]Basic Git commands for local version control.\

[x] The importance of version tracking and meaningful commit messages.\

[x]How to use Git in Jupyter for managing code changes.
