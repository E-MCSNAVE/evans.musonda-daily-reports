This repository contains the daily reports of my python classes.

#**Day 00: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebook**

On day 0, we were introduced to Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment. The session focused on how to navigate through the Jupyter interface, understanding its components, and getting familiar with working within this environment. We also learned how to run cells and explored basic jupyter notebook functions.

#**Day 01: Variable Assignment and Data Types**

On Day 1, we learned about variable assignment and the various data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. The emphasis was on how to declare and assign values to variables, as well as understanding how Python automatically assigns a data type based on the assigned value.

#**Day 02: Strings in Depth**

On day 2, we continued our exploration of variables, focusing specifically on strings. We examined different methods and functions associated with string manipulation, such as concatenation, slicing, and string formatting. We also covered string methods like upper(), lower(), replace(), and split().

#**Day 03 : Version Control with Git (Local)**

On day 03, we focused on understanding and practicing version control using Git in a local repository. We explored how Git helps in tracking changes, managing different versions of files, and ensuring collaborative development in a controlled environment. The session also involved interacting with the Jupyter environment to implement Git commands and reference key concepts.

Key Takeaways:

Basic Git commands for local version control.

The importance of version tracking and meaningful commit messages.

How to use Git in Jupyter for managing code changes.

**Day 04: Iterable objects and containers**
On day 04, we looked at objects and containers such as lists, dictionaries, and turples. We learned about methods for manipulating lists (append(), remove()), dictionaries (keys(), get()). Practical exercises involved creating and manipulating these objects.

---

**Day 05: Flow Control and conditinal statements** 
On day 05, We Focused on flow control using conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loops (for and while). We learned how to use conditions to guide program execution and practiced writing loops to iterate over sequences and control repetition in code.
